function varargout = mono_slam(varargin)
% MONO_SLAM M-file for mono_slam.fig
%      MONO_SLAM, by itself, creates a new MONO_SLAM or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = MONO_SLAM returns the handle to a new MONO_SLAM or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      MONO_SLAM('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in MONO_SLAM.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      MONO_SLAM('Property','Value',...) creates a new MONO_SLAM or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before mono_slam_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to mono_slam_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
